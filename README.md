### Hang in There  

# Abstract:
We built a simple, user-friendly application that generates and displays random motivational posters. If the user has favorites, they can save the posters to their library and delete the posters they no longer wish to keep. The user can also input their own image, title and quote to create their own unique poster. The app solves the problem of creating unique motivational posters that could be saved by the user for self-affirmations and positivity!

### Installation Instructions:
#### To install and make your own posters using Terminal
- Fork and clone this repository to your preferred directory
- Type `cd hang-in-there-pairing-project` to move into root directory

### Context:

### Learning Goals:
Learning how to use HTML, CSS, and JS and how they interact with the DOM to create a useable application was a goal for us. We used git and utilized branches to isolate features being worked on so we could pull down previous iterations if needed. We also learned how to navigate Github and merge conflicts. It was very beneficial to work through the project and to solidify our knowledge that we have learned so far. 

### Wins + Challenges:
We were able to complete iterations to have a functional application for the user to interact with. Seeing how the grid connects hidden CSS and utilizes the DOM was a challenge but also a win when we figured it out. 

A challenge that we faced is utilizing all the concepts and how they work together while trying fully understanding them given we haven't completed some of the lessons. 

Collaboration was important as we made sure to establish our DTR expectations.
